# Tank Detector

This project is a Machine Learning pipeline to detect tanks in images.

## Structure

- `model/`: training pipeline and saved model
- `api/`: FastAPI backend for predictions
- `frontend/`: simple interface (HTML/JS or Streamlit)
- `docs/`: documentation

## Goal

Train a model that can detect the presence of a tank in an image and provide an API and simple frontend for testing.
